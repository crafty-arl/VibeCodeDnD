# Playground Separate UI Implementation

## Overview
Successfully separated Playground Mode into its own dedicated UI screen, making it independent from Campaign Mode with cleaner navigation.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Game Mode System
Added a `gameMode` state to manage three distinct screens:
- **`menu`** - Main menu with mode selection
- **`campaign`** - Traditional campaign gameplay
- **`playground`** - Creative storytelling mode

### 2. Type Updates (`src/types/game.ts`)
```typescript
export type GameMode = 'menu' | 'campaign' | 'playground';
```

### 3. Navigation Flow

#### Main Menu (`gameMode === 'menu'`)
- Campaign Mode button → enters campaign mode
- Playground Mode button → enters playground mode
- Quick Start button → enters campaign with random deck
- Configuration options (Deck Manager, Dungeon Master, Voice)

#### Campaign Mode (`gameMode === 'campaign'`)
- Shows Campaign home screen with deck selection
- Full campaign gameplay (intro, challenge, resolution, transition)
- Campaign-specific header with Glory/Dice stats
- Back to menu from header

#### Playground Mode (`gameMode === 'playground'`)
- Dedicated playground setup screen
- Full playground gameplay interface
- No Glory/Dice stats in header (playground uses different mechanics)
- Back to menu button

### 4. Updated Components

#### GameHeader (`src/components/GameHeader.tsx`)
- Added `gameMode` prop
- Shows stats bar only in campaign mode
- Shows action buttons based on current mode
- Cleaner separation of concerns

#### App.tsx
Key changes:
```typescript
const [gameMode, setGameMode] = useState<'menu' | 'campaign' | 'playground'>('menu');

const handleStartCampaignMode = () => {
  setGameMode('campaign');
  setPhase('home');
};

const handleStartPlaygroundMode = () => {
  setGameMode('playground');
  setPlaygroundPhase('setup');
};

const handleBackToMenu = () => {
  setGameMode('menu');
  // ... reset states
};
```

### 5. Conditional Rendering
All phases now check `gameMode` before rendering:
```typescript
// Main Menu
{gameMode === 'menu' && ...}

// Campaign phases
{gameMode === 'campaign' && phase === 'intro' && ...}
{gameMode === 'campaign' && phase === 'challenge' && ...}

// Playground phases
{gameMode === 'playground' && playgroundPhase === 'setup' && ...}
{gameMode === 'playground' && playgroundPhase === 'playing' && ...}
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Clearer UX**
- Users explicitly choose which mode they want
- No confusion between campaign and playground
- Each mode has its own dedicated space

### 2. **Better Organization**
- Separated concerns: campaign logic vs playground logic
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Clear navigation hierarchy

### 3. **Scalability**
- Easy to add more game modes in the future
- Each mode can have unique UI/features
- Independent state management

### 4. **Playground Independence**
- Playground now has its own full-screen experience
- Not constrained by campaign UI
- Can have playground-specific features without affecting campaign

## Configuration

### Game Mode Storage
- Mode selection is ephemeral (resets on app reload)
- Each mode maintains its own session state
- Campaign auto-save still works
- Playground scenes can be saved independently

### Header Display
```typescript
// Campaign: Shows Glory + Dice + Progress bar
gameMode === 'campaign' → Full stats bar

// Playground: Clean header, no game stats
gameMode === 'playground' → Title only

// Menu: Title only
gameMode === 'menu' → Title only
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- [ ] Arena Mode (card battles)
- [ ] Story Mode (pre-written campaigns)
- [ ] Multiplayer Mode
- [ ] Tutorial Mode

### Playground-Specific Features
- [x] Dedicated UI screen ✅
- [x] Scene-by-scene image generation ✅
- [ ] Story gallery/browser
- [ ] Share stories with friends
- [ ] Import/export stories
- [ ] Custom themes/styles

### Campaign-Specific Features
- [ ] Achievement system
- [ ] Leaderboards
- [ ] Daily challenges
- [ ] Campaign progression tracking

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Main menu displays three mode options
- [x] Campaign mode button enters campaign
- [x] Playground mode button enters playground
- [x] Campaign header shows stats
- [x] Playground header hides stats
- [x] Back buttons return to main menu
- [x] Images generate in playground scenes
- [x] Campaign gameplay still works
- [x] Session save/load still works

## Technical Notes

### State Management
Each mode manages its own state:
- **Menu**: Configuration states (deck builder, narrator, audio)
- **Campaign**: Game phases, cards, glory, dice
- **Playground**: Scenes, memory, AI co-authoring

### Image Integration
- Playground scenes automatically generate images via Pollinations AI
- Images displayed above narrative text
- Session-based aesthetic consistency
- See `POLLINATIONS_IMAGE_INTEGRATION.md` for details

## Migration Guide

### For Users
No migration needed! Existing saved games will load in campaign mode.

### For Developers
If extending the UI:
1. Add new mode to `GameMode` type
2. Create mode-specific handlers
3. Add conditional rendering in App.tsx
4. Update GameHeader if needed

## Summary

The Playground now has its own dedicated UI screen, completely separate from Campaign Mode. This provides:
- ✅ Cleaner user experience
- ✅ Better organization
- ✅ Scalability for future modes
- ✅ Playground-specific features (image generation!)
- ✅ Maintained campaign functionality

Users can now choose their adventure path from the main menu and enjoy focused, mode-specific experiences!
