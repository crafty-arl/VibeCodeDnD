## Technical Implementation

### Files Created
- `src/types/tutorial.ts` - TypeScript types for tutorial state
- `src/components/TutorialOverlay.tsx` - Main tutorial UI components
- Updated `src/App.tsx` - Tutorial integration with game flow

### State Management
```typescript
const [tutorialActive, setTutorialActive] = useState(false);
const [tutorialStep, setTutorialStep] = useState<TutorialStep>('welcome');
const [tutorialCompleted, setTutorialCompleted] = useState(false);
```

### Persistence
- Tutorial completion status saved to `localStorage` as `quest_tutorial_completed`
- Persists across sessions
- Can be reset by clearing browser data

## How It Works

### For First-Time Users
1. User selects Campaign Mode
2. Clicks "Roll Initiative"
3. Tutorial automatically starts with welcome screen
4. Tutorial guides through entire first encounter
5. User completes tutorial or skips
6. Tutorial marked as completed in localStorage

### For Returning Users
1. "Replay Tutorial" button appears on home screen
2. Clicking it restarts tutorial from the beginning
3. Can be skipped at any time

### Tutorial Progression Logic
The tutorial advances automatically at key game events:
- **Game mode selection** ‚Üí advances to campaign intro
- **Starting game** ‚Üí advances to intro scene
- **Continuing from intro** ‚Üí advances to challenge
- **Selecting 3 cards** ‚Üí advances to card selection/stat requirements
- **Playing cards** ‚Üí advances to action paths
- **Choosing path** ‚Üí advances to resolution ‚Üí rewards
- **Next encounter click** ‚Üí advances to next encounter explanation ‚Üí complete

## Customization

### Adding New Tutorial Steps
1. Add step to `TutorialStep` type in `src/types/tutorial.ts`
2. Add step config to `tutorialSteps` object in `TutorialOverlay.tsx`
3. Add step to `tutorialStepOrder` array in `App.tsx`
4. Add advancement logic in relevant game phase handlers

### Modifying Tutorial Content
Edit the `tutorialSteps` object in `src/components/TutorialOverlay.tsx`:
```typescript
const tutorialSteps: Record<TutorialStep, {
  title: string;
  message: string;
  icon: React.ReactNode;
  tips?: string[];
}> = {
  // ... step configurations
}
```
