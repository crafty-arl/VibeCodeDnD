### 3. Add Workers AI Binding
- **Binding name:** `AI`
- **Model:** `@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5` (automatically available)

### 4. Add Environment Variables
Go to Settings → Environment variables:

- **Name:** `VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- **Value:** `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`

- **Value:** `openai/gpt-4o`
- **Apply to:** Production & Preview
