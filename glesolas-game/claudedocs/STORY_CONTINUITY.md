# Story Continuity Implementation

**Feature**: AI-powered narrative continuity across scenes
**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## The Problem You Identified

Each AI-generated scene was **isolated** - the intro didn't flow into the resolution. The story felt disconnected:

```
❌ Before:
Intro:   "The Dice Hoarder entered the basement clutching a cursed d20."
Challenge: "A rules debate erupts."
Resolution: "With luck, you succeeded through random chance."
           ↑ No connection to the intro or challenge!
```

## The Solution: Story Context Passing

Now the **intro scene** is passed to the **resolution prompt**, so the AI can reference what happened:

```
✅ After:
Intro:   "The Dice Hoarder entered the basement clutching a cursed d20."
Challenge: "A rules debate erupts."
Resolution: "The cursed d20 rolled a nat 20—statistically impossible, yet here we are.
             The rules debate ended instantly as everyone stared at the basement
             table in stunned silence."
           ↑ References the intro, the challenge, AND the outcome!
```

## How It Works

### 1. Intro Scene Generation (Unchanged)
```typescript
// Generate intro from 3 cards
const introScene = await generateIntroSceneAsync(cards);

// Store in state for later use
setIntroScene(introScene);
```

### 2. Resolution Scene Generation (Enhanced)
```typescript
// Pass intro scene to resolution generator
const scene = await generateResolutionSceneAsync(
  selectedCards,
  path,              // might/fortune/cunning
  success,           // true/false
  currentChallenge.scene,  // The challenge text
  introScene         // 🎯 NEW: Story continuity
);
```

### 3. AI Prompt Enhancement

**Resolution Prompt Now Includes**:
```typescript
**Story So Far:**
Previous scene: "${introScene}"
Challenge faced: "${challenge}"

**What Happened:**
- The player used ${path} and ${success ? 'succeeded' : 'failed'}
- Cards played: ${cards with flavor text}

**Style:** Continue the story from the intro scene.
           Reference what happened. Make it feel connected.
```

## Example Story Flow

### Scenario: Veteran Dice Hoarder + Cursed d20 + Dave's Mom's Basement

**Intro Scene (AI Generated)**:
> "The Veteran Dice Hoarder descended into Dave's Mom's Basement, their collection
> of d20s jingling in their pockets. But one die, the Cursed d20, seemed to whisper
> dark promises of inevitable failure."

**Challenge** (Static Template):
> "The dice betray you—three nat 1s in a row. The table goes silent. The GM smiles."

**Player Action**: Selects 3 cards, chooses **Fortune** path → **SUCCESS**

**Resolution Scene (AI Generated with Context)**:
> "Against every law of probability, the Cursed d20 that always rolls 1 suddenly
> came up 20. Twice. In Dave's Mom's Basement, the impossible happened, and the
> table erupted in confused celebration. The Veteran Dice Hoarder just nodded—
> they'd seen stranger things in this basement."

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

**`src/lib/promptBuilder.ts`**:
```typescript
export function buildResolutionPrompt(
  cards: LoreCard[],
  path: 'might' | 'fortune' | 'cunning',
  success: boolean,
  challenge?: string,
  introScene?: string  // 🎯 NEW PARAMETER
): string {
  return `Create a brief resolution (2-3 sentences)...

**Story So Far:**
${introScene ? `Previous scene: "${introScene}"` : ''}
${challenge ? `Challenge faced: "${challenge}"` : ''}
...
**Style:** Continue the story from the intro scene. Reference what happened.
`;
}
```

**`src/data/scenes.ts`**:
```typescript
export async function generateResolutionSceneAsync(
  cards: LoreCard[],
  path: SkillPath,
  success: boolean,
  challenge?: string,
  introScene?: string,  // 🎯 NEW PARAMETER
  useAI: boolean = true
): Promise<string> {
  const prompt = buildResolutionPrompt(
    cards,
    path,
    success,
    challenge,
    introScene  // 🎯 PASSED TO PROMPT
  );
  // ... rest of function
}
```

**`src/App.tsx`**:
```typescript
// Resolution now receives intro for continuity
const scene = await generateResolutionSceneAsync(
  selectedCards,
  path,
  success,
  currentChallenge.scene,
  introScene  // 🎯 STORY CONTINUITY
);
```

## Story Continuity Features

### What the AI Now References

**Intro → Resolution**:
- ✅ Character/item/location from intro
- ✅ The specific challenge faced
- ✅ The path taken (might/fortune/cunning)
- ✅ The outcome (success/failure)
- ✅ Card flavor text and abilities

### Narrative Coherence

**Before (Disconnected)**:
```
Intro: "You enter the game store."
Resolution: "You succeeded with cunning."
```

**After (Connected)**:
```
Intro: "The Rules Lawyer entered the game store, rulebook in hand."
Resolution: "Flipping to page 237 of the rulebook, the Rules Lawyer
             proved their point with devastating accuracy. The game
             store fell silent in begrudging respect."
```

## Token Usage Impact

### Before Story Continuity
- Intro prompt: ~150 tokens
- Resolution prompt: ~150 tokens
- **Total per encounter**: ~300 tokens

### After Story Continuity
- Intro prompt: ~150 tokens
- Resolution prompt: ~250 tokens (includes intro text)
- **Total per encounter**: ~400 tokens

**Cost Impact**: +33% tokens (~+$0.001 per encounter with free tier)

**Trade-off**: Worth it for **dramatically better story coherence**

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Multi-Encounter Story Arcs
Track story across multiple encounters in a session:
```typescript
const sessionStory = [
  { intro: "...", challenge: "...", resolution: "..." },
  { intro: "...", challenge: "...", resolution: "..." },
  // Next resolution references BOTH previous encounters
];
```

### 2. Dynamic Challenge Generation
Generate challenges that flow from the intro:
```typescript
// Challenge prompt includes intro scene
const challenge = await generateChallengeAsync(cards, introScene);
// "After entering the basement, you notice..."
```

### 3. Session Memory
Store session narrative in localStorage:
```typescript
localStorage.setItem('glesolas_story_history', JSON.stringify({
  encounters: [...],
  characters: [...],
  runningNarrative: "..."
}));
```

## Testing the Story Flow

### How to Verify Continuity

1. **Start encounter**: Note the intro (characters/items/location)
2. **Face challenge**: Read the challenge description
3. **Resolve encounter**: Check if resolution references:
   - ✅ Specific cards from intro
   - ✅ The challenge situation
   - ✅ How you succeeded/failed
   - ✅ The path you took (might/fortune/cunning)

### Example Test Session

**Session 1**:
```
Intro: "Forever-GM + Laminated GM Screen + Campaign Graveyard"
Resolution should mention: GM screen, graveyard, maybe unfinished campaigns
```

**Session 2**:
```
Intro: "Chaotic Murder Hobo + Cursed d20 + Convention Hall"
Resolution should mention: violence, dice curse, convention chaos
```

## Build Status

✅ TypeScript compilation: **PASSED**
✅ Production build: **464.48 KB** (5.10s)
✅ Story continuity: **IMPLEMENTED**
✅ Fallback system: **PRESERVED**

## Summary

**What Changed**:
- Resolution prompts now include intro scene text
- AI generates resolutions that reference the beginning of the story
- Token usage increased by ~100 tokens per encounter
- Story feels cohesive instead of random

**What Stayed the Same**:
- Template fallback still works
- Game mechanics unchanged
- Performance characteristics maintained
- Error handling preserved

**Result**:
Stories now flow from **intro → challenge → resolution** with the AI maintaining narrative continuity throughout the encounter.

---

**Ready to Test**: Run `npm run dev` and play through a full encounter. The resolution should naturally reference the intro scene!
