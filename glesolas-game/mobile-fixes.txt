MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS IMPROVEMENTS FOR /QUEST

=== ISSUES FOUND ===

1. CompactStatsHeader.tsx:
   - Level progress text can overflow on small screens
   - Touch targets too small (8x8px buttons)
   - "MAX LEVEL" text too long for mobile
   
2. App.tsx:
   - Button text could be shorter on mobile
   - Grid layouts need better responsive behavior
   
3. TutorialOverlay.tsx:
   - Long tutorial text needs better wrapping
   - Modal could be too wide on mobile
   
4. General Issues:
   - Some text not using whitespace-nowrap
   - Inconsistent touch target sizes
   - Missing responsive text sizing (text-base vs sm:text-lg)

=== FIXES TO APPLY ===

1. CompactStatsHeader.tsx:
   - Add flex-shrink-0 and whitespace-nowrap to prevent text wrapping
   - Show abbreviated text on mobile: "{gloryToNext}" vs "{gloryToNext} to {nextLevel.name}"
   - Change "MAX LEVEL" to "MAX" on mobile
   - Increase touch targets from h-8 w-8 to h-9 w-9 on mobile
   - Add touch-manipulation class for better touch response
   - Use responsive text sizes: text-base sm:text-lg
   - Change expanded view from flex to grid for better mobile layout

2. Add global CSS utility for touch-manipulation if needed

3. Ensure all buttons have minimum 44x44px touch targets on mobile (iOS HIG standard)

4. Use responsive spacing: gap-2 sm:gap-3
