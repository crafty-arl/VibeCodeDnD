# üåå **GLESOLAS ‚Äî MVP TECHNICAL & DESIGN PLAN**

---

## ü™∂ 1. Vision

**Glesolas** is an AI-powered storytelling card game.
Players combine cards representing **Characters, Items, and Locations** to create a story.

Each session begins with an **intro scene**, evolves through **AI-generated challenges**, and invites the player to respond with a new combination of cards using **Power, Luck, or Wit**.

Success in challenges earns **XP** and **Story Beats** (AI credits), allowing the story to continue.

## üéÆ 2. Core Gameplay Loop

| Phase              | Player Action                                                     | AI Response                                     | Outcome        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **1. Forge Start** | Draw 3 cards to start the story                                   | AI writes base scene                            | Story begins   |
| **2. Challenge**   | AI creates a challenge with 3 skill thresholds (Power, Luck, Wit) | Player prepares response                        | Stakes set     |
| **3. Response**    | Player plays 3 new cards                                          | AI narrates success/failure based on attributes | Scene resolved |
| **4. Reward**      | Player gains XP and Story Beats                                   | Session continues                               | Progression    |

Each *Beat* costs 1 Story Beat credit (AI call).
Each success earns extra Story Beats, enabling longer runs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Game Mechanic: Power / Luck / Wit

### 3.1 Card Stats

Each card contributes numeric values to the three attributes:

```json
{
  "Rogue Scholar": { "power": 2, "luck": 1, "wit": 3 },
  "Quill of Secrets": { "power": 1, "luck": 2, "wit": 2 },
  "Forgotten Archives": { "power": 0, "luck": 3, "wit": 1 }
}
```

### 3.2 Challenge Generation

Each challenge scene defines random skill thresholds:

```json
{
  "power_req": 6,
  "luck_req": 5,
  "wit_req": 8
}
```

### 3.3 Outcome Calculation

```js
const total = {
  power: card1.power + card2.power + card3.power,
  luck: card1.luck + card2.luck + card3.luck,
  wit:  card1.wit  + card2.wit  + card3.wit
};

const meets = {
  power: total.power >= challenge.power_req,
  luck:  total.luck  >= challenge.luck_req,
  wit:   total.wit   >= challenge.wit_req
};
```

* If multiple attributes meet thresholds, pick the highest total.
* If none meet, player fails challenge.

### 3.4 XP & Story Beats Reward

| Outcome   | XP  | Story Beats Gained |
| --------- | --- | ------------------ |
| Power Win | +50 | +2                 |
| Luck Win  | +40 | +2                 |
| Wit Win   | +60 | +2                 |
| Fail      | +20 | +1                 |
